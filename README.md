### TCP/UDP Connection
The task was to create simple chat operating on sockets that allows:
 - TCP communication among all users (every message is visible to everyone)
 - UDP communication among all users (every message is visible to everyone)
 - UDP communication among all users using multicast

Chat should use Threads to support multiple connections
